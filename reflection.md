Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I did talked about it a little with the person who sits next to me in class (I dont know their name...)
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I didn't attend any sessions
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    I like working with it because you can follow along with what you do wrong and exactly where there error is
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    The basic thought process is the same but the coding itself is different
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I first started with the response in the chat() method but when I moved it I had to change a couple things around because it was giving an error. Once everything was were it was supposed to be it was easy to figure out what what wrong and what wasn't. Some advice for someone taking this course in the future it to organize what is in each method first before adding any code.
